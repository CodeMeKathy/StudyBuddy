# StudyBuddy
### ***A flashcard learning tool..***

## Getting Started

This web application was created with simplicity in mind.  Developed with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and designed with Materialize. Clone and download this repository to your system to play with it yourself.  JavaScript is embedded in the application with a CDN link, enabling it to run without any additional downloads on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Begin your StudyBuddy dev experience, by visiting the [the GitHub repository]( https://github.com/CodeeMeKathy/StudyBuddy) to clone and download to your machine.

## Deployment

To access the deployed application, please visit [the GitHub repository]( https://CodeMeKathy.github.io/StudyBuddy/).


## Built With

* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - Provides the functionality of moving through the vocabulary. 
* [HTML](https://html.com/) - The web application structural framework
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Used to style and design the application.

## Instructions

Once deployed, to operate from your local machine:

- Use the 'key-up' button to flip to the next card in sequence. 
- Once you believe you have the correct answer, press 'enter' to see if you are correct. 
- If you feel your answer matches that of the pink flashcard then select correct answer.  If not, please select incorrect answer.
